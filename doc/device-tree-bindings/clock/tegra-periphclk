Clock controllers

(there isn't yet a binding in Linux, so this describes what is in U-Boot)

The device node for a clock controller is as described in the document
"Open Firmware Recommended Practice : Universal Serial Bus" with the
following modifications and additions :

This is based on Grant Likely's proposed patch for clock bindings.

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should be "tegra,periphclk" for peripheral clock controller
 - clocks : Should contain a single phandle pointing to the oscillator clock

Peripherals which refer to a clock should have a property called "clocks" with
two cells: phandle of the peripheral clock and the clock ID number (which
is the bit number in the peripheral clock controller enable register numbered
from 0).

Example:

clocks {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;

	/* The frequency of this clock is board-specific */
	osc_clk: oscclk {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
	};

	/*
	 * This node provides clocks to all peripherals. We don't
	 * enumerate the clock names for now since there are no
	 * users of this information.
	 */
	periph_clk: periphclk {
		compatible = "tegra,periphclk";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&osc_clk>;
		reg = <0x60006000 400>;
	};
};

usb@c5004000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-ehci", "usb-ehci";
	reg = <0xc5004000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = < 53 >;
	phy_type = "ulpi";
	clocks = <&periph_clk 58>;	// PERIPH_ID_USB2
};
